-------------

105 foo.asm
use "level/foo.asm"

105 c:\blah\foo.asm

apply Combine() and it'll give the full path for anything the user types

level:
105 foo.asm

gamemode:
14 ../level/foo.asm

will cause both to use the same resource....which could be bad

the only real problem here is that levels have load: while ow/gm don't
(other labels in the future could have a similar issue)

I guess that's fine though...just waste the 2 bytes for the pointer to load: even if the resource isn't being used for levels

------------

TODO: make sure to note that extra bytes in nmi: on sa-1 must be accessed with $0000-0001 instead of $00-01
      and, scratch in nmi: on sa-1 must be accessed as $0000-F
      and sa-1 or lorom must restore any scratch changed

- Oh, I like "Environment" as a general term encompassing level vs. gamemode vs. overworld (not to be confused with System.Environment :/ )
- Consider having an enum of environment types, and putting everything in arrays of 3 (since that's the enum size),
  and writing as much as possible with this in mind
- Fix/double check all the label type offsets in the patches (maybe make these defines)
- Can always work on overhauling doc when I want
- check duplicate library filenames (blah, this whole thing sucks)


--------------------------

Things for future versions:

- Pixi/GPS-like routine system
- specify library dependency and expose labels
- omit a resource from non-nmi call list if that resource only has nmi and no other labels
