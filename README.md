# UberASM Tool
UberASM Tool is a program for managing UberASM resources for Super Mario World romhacks.  UberASM Tool applies several hijacks in key places in an SMW ROM which allow it to run code for these resources at specific times during the game, such as once per frame during levels. This approach offers a good compromise between flexibility and ease of managing resources; resources can be added, removed, or applied to different levels easily.
